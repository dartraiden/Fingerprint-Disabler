# **Fingerprint Disabler**

## Description
This Magisk module disables the fingerprint scanner on Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. The module does not delete files, but only changes the permissions. Supports both stock and custom ROMs, as well as Treble-based ROMs.

This is not my own work. I just ported it to Magisk.

## Requirements
- Xiaomi Redmi Note 4
- Magisk v15+
